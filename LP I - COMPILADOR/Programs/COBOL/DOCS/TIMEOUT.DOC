  General Format


  For both Format 1 and Format 2 of the ACCEPT statement as documented in
  the Screen Handling chapter of the Language Reference, the following
  additional phrase is provided.

  +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  |                                                                        |
  |           { TIME-OUT  }        { integer-7    }                        |
  |           { --------  }        {              }                        |
  |           {           } AFTER  {              }                        |
  |           {           }        {              }                        |
  |           { TIMEOUT   }        { identifier-8 }                        |
  |           { -------   }        {              }                        |
  |                                                                        |
  +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  Syntax Rules

  1.  Identifier-8 must be an integer.  It may be signed.  If unsigned it is
      treated as positive.

  2.  Integer-7 must be an integer which may optionally be signed.  If
      unsigned it is treated as positive.


  General Rules

  1.  If identifier-8 or integer-7 has a negative value, this represents a
      request that no time-out "exception" should occur no matter how long
      there is between/before key-strokes.

  2.  If identifier-8 or integer-7 is zero, this indicates that a time-out
      should not occur if characters are waiting. However, if no characters
      are waiting (when the ACCEPT is processed), then issue a time-out
      immediately.

  3.  The ON EXCEPTION clause, if present, will be executed when a Time-Out
      occurs and a time-out clause is specified.  The NOT ON EXCEPTION
      clause, if present, will be executed when a Time-Out clause is specified
      but no time-out (or other exception) occurs.

  4.  If a Time-Out exception occurs, then the contents of any ACCEPT
      resultant-field will be defined as follows:

      a.  Any field which has been partially modified will contain any
          information which has already been received.
      b.  Fields which have "FULL" or "REQUIRED" attributes or any other
          attribute which would normally impact partial field input, will NOT
          be required to meet those attributes when a partial field entry has
          occurred when a TIMEOUT exception occurs.
      c.  The rules listed above apply whether or not the timeout clock is
          reset upon each keystroke.

  5.  If at run-time a positive timeout interval greater than 2,147,483,647
      hundredths of a second is detected the timeout value will be reset to
      2,147,483,647 hundredths of a seconds (which is approximately eight
      months).

  6.  The Time-Out value specifies the number of seconds (or tenths of a
      second) after the ACCEPT statement begins processes until a time-out
      exception occurs.  A new ADISCF configuration option controls
      whether or not the TIMEOUT clock is "reset" each time a new keyboard
      action is detected.  An application which wants some ACCEPT statements
      to be handled with a RESET and some without, may make specific CALLs
      to the ADIS run-time interface before or after the ACCEPT statements
      that need changes from the default.  For example when ADIS was
      configured not to do resets, if a program had:

        ACCEPT INPUT-FIELD RIME-OUT AFTER +10

      Then a time-out would occur after 10 seconds had elapsed from the
      beginning of the ACCEPT, even if some characters were entered after 5
      seconds into the ACCEPT processing.

      If, on the other hand, ADIS were configured to do resets, if a program
      had the same code given above, then each time a new character were
      entered, the timeout "clock" would be reset to zero.

   8. If a Time-Out exception occurs and no On Exception phrase is specified,
      then the CRT Status keys (if specified) are updated, the application
      continues to the logically next phrase, and the contents of the ACCEPT
      receiving field are as defined above.  (The above is true whether or not
      a NOT ON EXCEPTION phrase is specified.)

   9. All references to (NOT) ON EXCEPTION phrases within this proposal also
      apply to (NOT) ON ESCAPE phrases.

  Configuring the TIMEOUT options using ADISCF
  --------------------------------------------
  Two new Accept/Display options are available in ADISCF to allow
  configuration of TIMEOUT. They are as follows:

  Option 31 - Selection of the units used when calculating TIMEOUT on
              an accept.

              1 - Units used are seconds

              2 - Units used are tenths of a second


  Option 32 - Control of the timer used to calculate accept TIMEOUT.

              1 - The timer is never reset. Timeout will occur
                  at the specified length of time after the accept is
                  initiated

              2 - Timeout is reset to its original value each time a
                  character is entered.


  Changing the TIMEOUT options at run-time
  ----------------------------------------
  Two new X"AF" calls are provided to allow the TIMEOUT options shown
  above to be altered at run-time. The calls have the following format

     CALL X"AF" USING Set-Bit-Pairs Parameter-Block

  where the parameters are defined as follows:

     01 Set-Bit-Pairs              PIC 9(2) COMP-X VALUE 1.
     01 Parameter-Block.
       03 Bit-Pair-Setting         PIC 9(2) COMP-X.
       03 FILLER                   PIC X VALUE "6".
       03 Bit-Pair-Number          PIC 9(2) COMP-X.
       01 FILLER                   PIC 9(2) COMP-X VALUE 1.

  The values to be set for the fields Bit-Pair-Setting and Bit-Pais-Number
  are given in each of the descriptions below.

  With each call, if an error occurs, Set-Bit-Pairs will return the value
  255.


  Select Timeout units.
  ---------------------
  Allows selection of the units to be used when calculating TIMEOUT.

    Bit-Pair-Number must be set to 14.

    Bit-Par-Setting should be one of the following values:

      0  -   Units are seconds

      1  -   Units are tenths of a second


  Control Timeout Reset
  ---------------------
  Allows control of the timer used to calculate TIMEOUT on an accept.

    Bit-Pair-Number must be set to 15.

    Bit-Par-Setting should be one of the following values:

      0  -   Timer is never reset. Timeout occurs after the specified
             time from the start of the accept.

      1  -   The timer is reset each time a character is entered.
