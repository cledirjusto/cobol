      *    This program demonstrates how to send escape          *
      *    sequences to a printer.  In this case, an Okidata 93  *
      *    parallel printer was used and the escape sequences in *
      *    question were to set form length to either "7" or     *
      *    "11".  To determine the proper escape sequences for   *
      *    the printer in question, consult your printer manual. *
