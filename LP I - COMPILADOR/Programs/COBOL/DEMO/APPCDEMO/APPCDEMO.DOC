   Introduction
   ------------

       This document describes how to run a demonstration which uses
       Advanced Program to Program Communication to communicate between two
       programs on a network.

       The demonstration is the game Battleships.  Each program controls
       the two player's views of the battle scene, showing positions of his
       own ships and coordinates where previous attacks have been made.
       The game involves a simple two way communication of sending
       coordinates, receiving opponent's damage reports, receiving
       opponent's attack coordinates and sending own damage reports.
       Instructions for playing the game are provided later.

       If you have no previous knowledge of APPC, we recommend that you read
       the IBM OS/2 Extended Edition Version 1.1 APPC Programming Reference
       manual to gain a basic understanding of the concepts and terminology.
       For detailed information about configuring Communications Manager,
       refer to the IBM Operating System/2 Extended Edition Version 1.1
       System Administrator's Guide for Communications.  Also read the
       section on using APPC in the document INTERFAC.DOC.


   Hardware/Software requirements
   ------------------------------

   Hardware:

      o Two IBM PS/2s or machines capable of running IBM OS/2 1.1 Extended
        Edition

      o Memory enough to run IBM OS/2 1.1 EE with Communications Manager,
        this will be around 6 megabytes.

      o Both machines to be connected to an IBM Token Ring Network or PC LAN
        Network

   System Software:

       o IBM OS/2 1.1 Extended Edition

       o Communications Manager (CM)

       o CM configuration profile to run APPC

       o Network Driver software relevent to type of network being used

   Application Software:

       o The following programs/configurations have been provided:

           BATTLEL.CBL  - main program for local machine
           BATTRER.CBL  - main program for remote machine
           BATTLE.WKS   - working storage copy file
           BATTLE.SS    - screen section copy file
           BATTLE.CBL   - procedure copy file
           BATTLE.CMD   - batch file to create run files
           BATTAPPC.CBL - communications interface
           APPCBATL.CFG - CM configuration profile for local machine
           APPCBATR.CFG - CM configuration profile for remote machine
           ADAPTER.EXE  - Utility program to get adapter address
           APPC.CPY     - APPC COBOL definitions (appc basic/mapped verbs)
           ACSSVC.CPY   - ACSSVC COBOL definitions (common service verbs)

       o APPC.CPY and ACSSVC.CPY are general purpose copy files, and can be
         used by any COBOL APPC application.  The files contain definitions
         for each verb's control block, operation codes, error codes and
         constants.


   Amending the configuration profiles
   -----------------------------------

   Before you can start running the demonstration programs you must amend
   one and possibly both the configuration files. The configurations
   provided assume that you will be using an IBM Token Ring Network running
   on a PS/2 machine. If you have a different type of machine or you are
   using a different DLC type (eg. IBM PC Network ) it is likely that you
   will have to amend the configurations.

   The other change, which you should make to APPCBATL.CFG, is to fill in
   the adapter number field in the Partner Logical Unit Profiles of the SNA
   Feature Profiles menu.  This tells Communications Manager which machine
   on the network to talk converse with.

   The profile which you should change is called DEMOPLU.  To change this
   field:

     o start Communications Manager with the configuration file as a
       parameter: 'CM APPCBATL'
     o press F10 and select 'A' to get to the advanced pull down menu
     o select 'C' for configuration
     o enter configuration name APPCBATL (if not already shown) and press
       enter key
     o select the SNA Feature Profiles menu
     o select the PLU profile menu
     o enter 'H' to change profile
     o enter profile name 'DEMOPLU1' and press enter key
     o press enter key to accept first screen
     o move cursor to adapter number field and enter the adapter address of
       the network adapter card in the machine that will use the other
       configuration ie. APPCBATR.CFG.
     o keep pressing the enter key until you reach the SNA Feature
       Configuration menu, then press the escape key to get back to
       Communication Configuration menu
     o press F10 and then 'V' and the enter key to verify the changes you
       have made
     o the verification should complete successfully
     o exit Communications Manager

   The adapter number is the hard coded address of the network adapter card
   (each card is given a unique address by the manufacturer). You can find out
   this address by running ADAPTER.EXE (OS/2 1.1), or by looking in ACSLAN.LOG
   in the CMLIB directory (OS/2 1.2) on the machine which will use the
   configuration file 'APPCBATR.CFG'.


   Changing CONFIG.SYS
   -------------------

   The device drivers which control the network hardware require the CM
   configuration profiles to be specified as parameters.

   If you are using a IBM Token Ring Network amend the following lines in
   CONFIG.SYS.
       o on the local machine:

           DEVICE=C:\CMLIB\TRNETDD.SYS CFG=C:\CMLIB\APPCBATL.CFG
           DEVICE=C:\CMLIB\NETBDD.SYS CFG=C:\CMLIB\APPCBATL.CFG

       o on the remote machine:

           DEVICE=C:\CMLIB\TRNETDD.SYS CFG=C:\CMLIB\APPCBATR.CFG
           DEVICE=C:\CMLIB\NETBDD.SYS CFG=C:\CMLIB\APPCBATR.CFG

   If you are using a IBM PC LAN Network amend the following lines in
   CONFIG.SYS.
       o on the local machine:

           DEVICE=C:\CMLIB\PCNETDD.SYS CFG=C:\CMLIB\APPCBATL.CFG
           DEVICE=C:\CMLIB\NETBDD.SYS CFG=C:\CMLIB\APPCBATL.CFG

       o on the remote machine:

           DEVICE=C:\CMLIB\PCNETDD.SYS CFG=C:\CMLIB\APPCBATR.CFG
           DEVICE=C:\CMLIB\NETBDD.SYS CFG=C:\CMLIB\APPCBATR.CFG

       After changing CONFIG.SYS reboot both machines so that the device
       drivers are reactivated with the correct configurations.


   Starting Communications Manager
   -------------------------------

       Before you start running the demo program you must make sure that you
       have started Communications Manager (CM) on each machine with the
       respective configuration file active.  To make the configuration
       active supply its name as a parameter when you start CM.

       eg. STARTCM APPCBATL

       If you receive any error messages when you start CM you should fix
       these problems before attempting to run the programs.  If you do have
       problems record the error message number and refer to the IBM OS/2 EE
       Manual on Programming Services and Problem Determination for
       Communications for help.


   Compiling and running the demonstration
   ---------------------------------------

   The demonstration programs can be compiled for use with Animator or as
   object files which can then be linked to produce standalone executable
   programs.

   A batch file has been provided : BATTLE.CMD which will create the
   files to run the demonstration.  The batch file will produce files for
   animation or for direct execution.

   To run the demonstration, start BATTLEL on the machine that has
   configuration profile APPCBATL.CFG active.

   If there are no problems with the connection, a message on the remote
   machine should appear instructing the operator to begin a transaction
   program called BATTLE.

   This message is your prompt to start BATTLER on the remote machine.

   If a conversation is established, the two programs should start to
   communicate with each other and the BATTLESHIPS game should start.

   If any errors occur, the program will stop and the error codes, together
   with the verb operation code will be displayed.  Refer to the APPC
   Reference Manual for information on error codes. Additional information
   is provided by the error log, which can be accessed from the Problem
   Determination menu of the Advanced features pull down menu. This provides
   information in the form of error codes which reference cause/diagnosis
   text in the Problem Determination for Communications manual - it will
   also report what area of communications the problem occured in.

   Unless you change the programs, the most likely cause of any problems
   that may occur will be due to problems in the configuration file.  The
   configurations provided are model profiles.  This means that you may have
   to amend some fields in the profile which suit the particular setup you
   have.  For example the LAN Adapter Type profile has been configured as an
   IBM Token-Ring Network Adapter /A card which is generally used by IBM
   PS/2 machines.  If you are using a different machine you will likely have
   to change the profile to configure a different type of card.  Also it is
   possible to have two adapter cards installed in a machine. The primary
   adapter card is known as Adapter 0 and the secondary as Adapter 1.  The
   configurations assume only one card is installed which define Adapter 0.
   If you have two cards, you may have to alter the profile to reflect this.


   User Instructions
   -----------------

   Before the game starts, both players should agree on how many ships that
   are going to take part and how many of each type of ship.  There are four
   types of ships: Aircraft Carrier, Battleship, Frigate and Gun-Boat,
   denoted by the letters: A,B,F and G respectively. There is no limit to
   the numbers of ships, nor of each type.  The only requirement is that
   different ships of the same type are not placed in adjacent locations to
   one another.

   The game starts for player 1. Player 1 selects a grid coordinate where he
   thinks an opponent ship is located. Coordinates are specified in column
   row order (eg. F2).  After a while, player 1 will receive a damage report
   of the earlier attempt this will be either a hit, a miss or a sinking.
   If a part of an opponent's ship has been hit, the grid location is
   colored red, a miss it is colored cyan and a sink, the whole ship is
   marked in black.  After this player 2 has his turn. The player who sinks
   all of his opponent's ships first wins the game.

   The game can be stopped by entering a grid location of Q.  This will
   send a message to the opponent to quit.
