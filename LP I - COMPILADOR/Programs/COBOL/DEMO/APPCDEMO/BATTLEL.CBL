      *    Battle-Grid defines the grid positions of different ships
      *    on this side.  It is up to each player to specify these
      *    positions and follow certain requirements of the game.
      *
      *    The requirements are:
      *        - ships are identified by the following letters:
      *                 A for Aircraft Carrier
      *                 B for Battleship
      *                 F for Frigate
      *                 G for Gun Boat
      *
      *        - ships can be any length - it is up to the players to
      *          decide how long each ship is
      *
      *        - ships must not be located in adjacent grid locations
      *
      *        - ships can only be aligned vertically or horizontally
      *
      *    There is no verification done on the setup you choose - so
      *    it is quite possible to cheat.  You must also recompile this
      *    program when you want to change the battle grid.
      *
      *    A possible enhancement which you may like to make yourself
      *    would be to provide code which allows each player to define
      *    his/her own grid details and validate the grid dynamically -
      *    thus removing the need to recompile every time.
